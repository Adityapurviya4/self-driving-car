# self-driving-car
A complete self-driving car project integrating computer vision, deep learning, sensor fusion, and path planning for autonomous navigation.

# 🚗 Self-Driving Car Project

This repository contains a full roadmap and implementation of a **self-driving car system**, from perception to control.  
It demonstrates how autonomous vehicles perceive the environment, plan their path, and drive safely — both in simulation and on real hardware.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project covers the core components of an autonomous driving pipeline:

1. **Perception** – Detect lanes, vehicles, and obstacles using computer vision and deep learning.  
2. **Localization** – Estimate the car’s position using SLAM and GPS data.  
3. **Path Planning** – Compute a safe, smooth route through the environment.  
4. **Control** – Use PID or MPC to follow the path and stay in the lane.  
5. **Integration** – Combine all systems into a single self-driving module.
